# Crowdfunding landing page challenge

## Project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

### Finished project here: [Crowdfunding: Frontend Mentor](https://crowdfunding-frontend-mentor.vercel.app)

This [Crowdfunding](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR) challenge had the following key requirements:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

In addition to tackling those areas above, I spent some time thinking about accessibility, implementing aria attributes and considering keyboard navigation. More work could be done on this to include assigning and changing tab indices on keyboard navigation, for example.

Frontend Mentor mark this as a 'Junior' challenge. Admittedly most of the concepts here could be considered fundamental, but there a lot to it!!
